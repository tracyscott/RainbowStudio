![Rainbow Studio](https://raw.github.com/tracyscott/RainbowStudio/master/assets/rainbowstudio.jpg)

[LX Studio](http://lx.studio/) is a digital lighting workstation, bringing concepts from digital audio workstations and modular synthesis into the realm of LED lighting control. Generative patterns, interactive inputs, and flexible parameter-driven modulation â€” a rich environment for lighting composition and performance.

## Getting Started

To set up RainbowStudio, perform the following steps:

1. [Download and install JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).
2. [Download and install Maven](https://maven.apache.org).
3. Clone this [project](https://github.com/tracyscott/RainbowStudio.git).
4. From the cloned directory, build the project using `mvn package`.
5. Change directories to `projects/` and execute
   `java -jar ../target/rainbowstudio-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar`.
5. RainbowStudio should launch with a side-scrolling white dot on a black grid
   1. Click "Folder" icon in top-center and select a pattern (e.g. "RainbowGifLife.lxp")
   2. RainbowStudio may show a blank screen. If it does, close it and reopen it.
   3. RainbowStudio should now show the desired pattern.

To Run RainbowStudio from IntelliJ:

1. Using IntelliJ, import Maven project from the cloned RainbowStudio directory
2. In the IntelliJ project, add run configuration using Maven template and enter 'compile exec:java' in command line field

Changes:

1. When making changes, do not forget to re-build the project either using command line or IntelliJ. 

Helpful links for Linux environments:

1. JDK 8: https://www.javahelps.com/2015/03/install-oracle-jdk-in-ubuntu.html
2. Maven: https://www.javahelps.com/2017/10/install-apache-maven-on-linux.html
3. Clone this [project](https://github.com/tracyscott/RainbowStudio.git).
4. IntelliJ: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=linux
5. Using IntelliJ, import Maven project from the cloned directory
6. Add a run configuration using a Maven template and enter 'compile exec:java' in command line

Common issues:
1. Window size error: set "lx.ui.setResizable(RESIZABLE);" to false

## Documentation

[LX Studio User Guide](https://github.com/tracyscott/RainbowStudio/blob/master/LXStudioUserGuide.md)

There is some minimal documentation on the
[LX Studio Wiki](https://github.com/heronarts/LXStudio/wiki).

The RainbowGIF pattern uses an 'out-b' animated gif from
[beeple](https://vimeo.com/129881600).

For Processing-based drawing check out the PGDraw2, AnimatedSprite,
or AnimatedSpritePP patterns.

Pattern names ending in 'PP' are pixel-perfect patterns. They render to a
straight 420x30 image which is effectively bent along the rainbow.  For
pixel art-type patterns, these work best.  It is also possible to sample from
an image but these will have aliasing effects because the Rainbow LEDs are in
polar coordinate space while images use cartesian coordinates. Most image-based
patterns have an antialias button to enable and disable antialiasing. Aliasing
is especially bad on high frequency images with movement (lots of animated,
overlapping geometric shapes). For sampled-image based patterns, the image is
scaled to match the dimensions of the entire top half-circle of the circle
defined by the Rainbow.  This makes it easier to directly use the Radius in
your image drawing code (see AnimatedSprite).  It is also useful for using
existing renderings as a texture, such as the RainbowGIF pattern.

Consult the [LX Studio API reference &rarr;](http://lx.studio/api/)

More and better documentation is coming soon!

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter an issue like the following on Linux:

```
com.jogamp.opengl.GLException: Caught ThreadDeath: null on thread main-FPSAWTAnimator#00-Timer0
    at com.jogamp.opengl.GLException.newGLException(GLException.java:76)
```

Then we recommend wiping your `.lxproject` file, selecting a `.lxp` file,
and rebooting RainbowStudio twice. It was causing us issues, potentially due
to odd-sized windows.

Building a big cool project? I'm probably interested in hearing about it!
